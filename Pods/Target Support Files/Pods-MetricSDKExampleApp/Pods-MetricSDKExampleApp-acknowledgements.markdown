## Using Metric SDK

The Metric SDK is intended for use by authorized users or individuals (referred to as “Authorized Users”) in line with the service contract with Inpath Technologies, known as “Inpath Contract”. If you do not hold a valid service contract with Inpath, and thus not an Authorized User, you acknowledge that you are not eligible to access, copy, share or attempt to modify any materials related to the Metric SDK, in parts or in whole.

When using the Metric SDK, you must comply with all applicable laws, local laws, the laws of your jurisdiction, and laws regarding the transmission of technical data.

You also agree not to:

- Violate copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property laws as embedded within the Metric SDK.
- Engage in reverse engineering, disassembling, or decompiling the Metric SDK's software, or employing any alternative methods or procedures to decipher the human-readable form of any software encompassed by the Metric SDK (excluding instances where such conversion is requisite for integrating the functionality of said software with other software or systems utilized by an Authorized User; this applies if Inpath has not supplied the necessary information for such integration within a reasonable timeframe after being requested by the Authorized User);
- Access any or all segments of the Metric SDK with the intention of constructing or aiding the creation of a product or service exhibiting functions
- Misrepresent the Metric SDK as an object of creation of any entity other than Inpath;
- Eliminate, obscure, or alter any indications of intellectual property rights or confidentiality statements displayed within or upon any aspect of the Metric SDK.
- Authorize, permit, enable, induce, or encourage any third party to do any of the above.

## Liability

The Metric SDK is provided “as-is” and we expressly disclaim all warranties, representations, and conditions, express or implied, including those of quality, merchantability, merchantable quality, durability, fitness for a particular purpose and those arising by statute. We are not liable for any loss, whether of money (including profit), goodwill, or reputation, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of your use of Metric SDK. In no circumstance shall Inpath be held accountable for any claims, damages, or liabilities, irrespective of whether they arise from contracts, torts, or any other legal grounds, associated with the Metric SDK or any form of engagement or interaction with the Metric SDK.

## Indemnity

Authorized Users must refer to their respective Inpath Contract to ascertain the approved manner in which they may employ the Metric SDK. No utilization of the Metric SDK by Authorized Users is sanctioned except as explicitly stipulated within the applicable Inpath Contract. You will indemnify and hold us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and employees) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this Agreement, or your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.

We reserve the rights to protect our rights using available measures if a violation of our terms is established in any form.

# iProov Biometrics SDK Terms

**iProov SDK Terms (the "Terms"):**

The iProov Software Development Kit ("iProov SDK") has been developed by iProov Limited ("iProov", "we", and "us").

The iProov SDK is to be accessed, downloaded, and/or used only by corporate or natural persons that are authorized to do so (each an "Authorized User") under a separate written agreement with iProov Limited (an "iProov Contract"). If you are not an Authorized User, you are not permitted to – and you agree that you shall not – access, download, distribute, copy, or otherwise use or exploit the iProov SDK or any part of it or its documentation.

The iProov SDK comprises elements that are iProov’s copyright, as well as elements that are licensed by third parties under certain open-source software licenses (each an "OSS Agreement"), which may be found below. Anyone accessing or downloading the iProov SDK is deemed to agree to the OSS Agreements and these Terms.

Authorized Users should consult their iProov Contract as to how they are permitted to use the iProov SDK. No usage by Authorized Users is allowed except as provided in the relevant iProov Contract.

Any rights Authorized Users may have to use the iProov SDK are subject to the OSS Agreements.

The iProov SDK is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall iProov be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the iProov SDK or any use of or other dealings with the iProov SDK.

Without limiting the above provisions of these Terms, you agree that you will not and will not allow a third party to:

a. Attempt to defeat, circumvent, or disable any copy protection mechanism in the iProov SDK;
b. Reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile iProov SDK software or apply any other process or procedure to derive the human-readable form of any software included in the iProov SDK (except to the extent that any reduction of such software to human-readable form is necessary for the purposes of integrating the operation of that software with other software or systems used by an Authorized User, if iProov has not provided the information necessary to achieve such integration within a reasonable period of the Authorized User requesting it);
c. Access all or any part of the iProov SDK to build or facilitate the build of a product or service that has functions or features similar to or competes with the iProov SDK or any of our products or services;
d. Remove, obscure, or alter any intellectual property right or confidentiality notices or legends appearing on any aspect of any of the iProov SDK;
e. Pass off the iProov SDK as being a work of any person or entity other than iProov and the licensors under OSS Agreements; or
f. Modify, distribute, alter, or tamper with the iProov SDK or any of its documentation, or otherwise do anything restricted by iProov’s copyright and other rights in the SDK and its documentation.

We reserve the right to take all steps available to us in enforcing our rights, whether under these Terms, our intellectual property rights, or otherwise.

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

agreement with iProov Limited (an "iProov Contract"). If you are not an Authorised User,
you are not permitted to – and you agree that you shall not – access, download, distribute,
copy or otherwise use or exploit the iProov SDK or any part of it or its documentation.

3. The iProov SDK comprises elements that are iProov’s copyright, as well as elements that are
licensed by third parties under certain open source software licences (each an "OSS
Agreement"), which may be found below.
Anyone accessing or downloading the iProov SDK is deemed to agree to the OSS Agreements
and these Terms.

4. Authorised Users should consult their iProov Contract as to how they are permitted to use
the iProov SDK. No usage by Authorised Users is allowed except as provided in the relevant
iProov Contract.

5. Any rights Authorised Users may have to use the iProov SDK are subject to the OSS
Agreements.

6. The iProov SDK is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied,
including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall iProov be liable for any claim, damages or
other liability, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection
with the iProov SDK or any use of or other dealings with the iProov SDK.

7. Without limiting the above provisions of these Terms, you agree that you will not and will
not allow a third party to:

	a. attempt to defeat, circumvent or disable any copy protection mechanism in the
iProov SDK;

	b. reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile iProov SDK software or apply any other
process or procedure to derive the human readable form of any software included in
the iProov SDK (except to the extent that any reduction of such software to human
readable form is necessary for the purposes of integrating the operation of that
software with other software or systems used by an Authorised User, if iProov has
not provided the information necessary to achieve such integration within a
reasonable period of the Authorised User requesting it);

	c. access all or any part of the iProov SDK in order to build or facilitate the build of a
product or service which has functions or features similar to or competes with the
iProov SDK or any of our products or services;
	
	d. remove, obscure or alter any intellectual property right or confidentiality notices or
legends appearing in or on any aspect of any of the iProov SDK;

	e. pass off the iProov SDK as being a work of any person or entity other than iProov
and the licensors under OSS Agreements; or

	f. modify, distribute, alter, or tamper with the iProov SDK or any of its documentation,
or otherwise do anything restricted by iProov’s copyright and other rights in the SDK
and its documentation.

8. We reserve the right to take all steps available to us in enforcing our rights, whether under
these Terms, our intellectual property rights or otherwise.

  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.

  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  the conditions stated in this License.

  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
