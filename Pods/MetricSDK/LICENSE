- Engage in reverse engineering, disassembling, or decompiling the Metric SDK's software, or employing any alternative methods or procedures to decipher the human-readable form of any software encompassed by the Metric SDK (excluding instances where such conversion is requisite for integrating the functionality of said software with other software or systems utilized by an Authorized User; this applies if Inpath has not supplied the necessary information for such integration within a reasonable timeframe after being requested by the Authorized User);
- Access any or all segments of the Metric SDK with the intention of constructing or aiding the creation of a product or service exhibiting functions

# iProov Biometrics SDK Terms

**iProov SDK Terms (the "Terms"):**

The iProov Software Development Kit ("iProov SDK") has been developed by iProov Limited ("iProov", "we", and "us").

The iProov SDK is to be accessed, downloaded, and/or used only by corporate or natural persons that are authorized to do so (each an "Authorized User") under a separate written agreement with iProov Limited (an "iProov Contract"). If you are not an Authorized User, you are not permitted to – and you agree that you shall not – access, download, distribute, copy, or otherwise use or exploit the iProov SDK or any part of it or its documentation.

The iProov SDK comprises elements that are iProov’s copyright, as well as elements that are licensed by third parties under certain open-source software licenses (each an "OSS Agreement"), which may be found below. Anyone accessing or downloading the iProov SDK is deemed to agree to the OSS Agreements and these Terms.

Authorized Users should consult their iProov Contract as to how they are permitted to use the iProov SDK. No usage by Authorized Users is allowed except as provided in the relevant iProov Contract.

Any rights Authorized Users may have to use the iProov SDK are subject to the OSS Agreements.

The iProov SDK is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall iProov be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the iProov SDK or any use of or other dealings with the iProov SDK.

Without limiting the above provisions of these Terms, you agree that you will not and will not allow a third party to:

a. Attempt to defeat, circumvent, or disable any copy protection mechanism in the iProov SDK;
b. Reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile iProov SDK software or apply any other process or procedure to derive the human-readable form of any software included in the iProov SDK (except to the extent that any reduction of such software to human-readable form is necessary for the purposes of integrating the operation of that software with other software or systems used by an Authorized User, if iProov has not provided the information necessary to achieve such integration within a reasonable period of the Authorized User requesting it);
c. Access all or any part of the iProov SDK to build or facilitate the build of a product or service that has functions or features similar to or competes with the iProov SDK or any of our products or services;
d. Remove, obscure, or alter any intellectual property right or confidentiality notices or legends appearing on any aspect of any of the iProov SDK;
e. Pass off the iProov SDK as being a work of any person or entity other than iProov and the licensors under OSS Agreements; or
f. Modify, distribute, alter, or tamper with the iProov SDK or any of its documentation, or otherwise do anything restricted by iProov’s copyright and other rights in the SDK and its documentation.

We reserve the right to take all steps available to us in enforcing our rights, whether under these Terms, our intellectual property rights, or otherwise.
